We are currently in a renaissance of board gaming, with thousands of new games being released every year. Board games 
have come a long way since the four hour slugfests of Monopoly and Risk that many played as a kid. Modern board games 
offer so much more varied and thematic gameplay, interesting decision making, and engaging social interaction.

The new titles are all incredibly diverse, including party games, cooperative games, word games, dexterity games, 
strategy games, real-time games, and much more. There’s a game out there for everyone! With so much of our time spent 
glued to screens nowadays, board games offer us the opportunity to socialize and bond with friends away from our 
laptops and phones.

An introduction wouldn’t be complete without some recommendations, so that is what’s coming next. Each category has 
been curated to contain a diverse selection of games that showcases different mechanics, themes, and complexities, 
so that you can acquire a taste of what modern board gaming has to offer!
